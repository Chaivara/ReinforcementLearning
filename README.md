# Reinforcment Learning

The algorithms were implemented using the book: "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On" written by Maxim Lapan.
He provides a github repo with multiple implementations, that can be found in here:
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On

## Project structure

The root folder consits of:
1. Different games, every game has an AI, models and graphs
2. requirements.txt (probably not up to date)
3. runTensorBoard {dir}, runs tensorboard on a choosen directory
4. old_agents, implementations of weaker RL algorithms

When you want to try out trained model, you have to set the LEARN flag in the ai file to false.
Different models are trained on different observations, so not everything will work. 
But the models names indicate the settings for the parameters.

## Disclaimer
* The environment is constantly being updated, thus saved models often are not usable anymore
* old_agents probably dont work because the folder structured changed often
